title: "Geek Event Weekend"
---

Thursday 13th Octobar was the day before [Magrails][magrails] and
[Barcamp Blackpool][bcblackpool] on the Friday and Saturday. The
[NWRUG][nwrug] for this month had been brought forward a month as a
pre-magrails event with all the evenings drinks being sponsered by
[Engine Yard][ey]. Before the drink up in the evening I met up with
[Adam Holt][adamholt] in the Common Bar. I spent the afternoon in there getting
some work done. I eventually made my way over to [NoHo][noho] where the event
was being held.

## North West Ruby User Group Drinkup

People slowly arrived for the evenings drinkup. I got talking to a few friends
about what they've been up to and other random topics. Few of the people from
[XP Manchester][xpman] turned up after their event.

It also seemed like many people forgot they would be attending
[Magrails][magrails] the next day and got slightly tipsy. [Martin][martinrue],
[Gemma][ruby_gem] and I made our way to Piccadilly to catch the train back to
Preston.

## Magrails

I got around four hours sleep that night and had to be up at 6am to get ready
for Magrails and head to the train station. I was suppose to be meeting Martin
at the station around 7:10, however he failed to get up in time and had to
catch the next train in 30 minutes.

I wait for Martin at Piccadilly station so we could head together to the venue
as planned. We jumped in a taxi to save a bit of time (well not much as the
taxi seemed to go some long way). First thing we did was line up to register
and get our swag bags, thanks to the awesome sponsers of the event.

It seemed as if the first half of the talks we mainly the agile talks, and the
second half were the code/rails related ones. I must admit the agile talks were
not that engaging for myself. I would have personally preferred a two track
conference with agile talks on one track, and code talks on the other.

The code related talks were fairly interesting, especially the deployment
related talk and [Aaron Patterson][tenderlove]'s talk on the new router for
rails; [Journey][journey].

Overall the first [Magrails][magrails] conference was amazing and totally
better than I had anticipated. The event was made a reality by the following
guys from On The Beach.

* [Chuck Hardy][chuckjhardy]
* [Francis Fish][fjfish]
* [Matt House][eightbitraptor]
* [Sean Handley][seanhandley]

I am looking forward to next years Magrails and hopefully it's going to be able
to top this years conferences. Once again I would like to thank the organisers
of the conference.

## Barcamp Blackpool

Luckily I got a few extra hours of sleep the night before Barcamp Blackpool. I
had to be at the train station to meet [Jonathon][jedw] for the 8:02 train to
Blackpool South. We got to the venue just as the lovely organiser (I say
lovely loosely as she can be quite violent) [Gemma][ruby_gem] was getting
there. People began to slowly arrive and mingle.

[Martin][martinrue], [Jonathon][jedw] and I reserved ourselves a booth at the
back of the main room. I sometimes think the booths are the main reason we
attend Barcamp Blackpool.

I mingled with a few friends and put some faces to people who I've only spoken
to on Twitter. I attended a few talks by friends, and the day quickly passed
and we made it to the evenings entertainment. Games of Werewolf and The Thing.
We were also subjected to some musically-challenged people playing Rockband in
the main room.

The games of Werewolf and The Thing were interesting and unforgetable for some
people like [Martin][martinrue] who effectively won a game for the Werewolves
without being a Werewolf himself. Oh he also plays a good Seer who points to
someone and goes back to sleep without finding the result. All in all I think
it was a good evening for Martin :).

A big thanks to [Gemma][ruby_gem] for organising an awesome Barcamp Blackpool
once again.

I finally made it home to my own bed around 1am for a well deserved sleep after
three days of solid geeking out. I'm looking forward to all the same events
next year.

I would like to also note there were a few of us who attended all three events
and are now recovering from the Blackpool Plague. I think it was totally worth
it for attending such great events. :)
