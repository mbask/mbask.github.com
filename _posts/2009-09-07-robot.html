  In MySpace Music, every profile has a list of so-called <strong>friends</strong>, musicians that are an inspiration, a model, that one likes, or has played live with. Most profiles have <strong>too many</strong> friends, and it is hard to understands which ones are musically associated and which ones are not.</p>
<p>MySpace Robot is a Python script that, given a seed profile, <strong>ranks the list of friends</strong> based on their affinity with the seed artist. For instance, given the profile of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/milesdavis" title="Open Miles Davis MySpace profile">Miles Davis</a>, MySpace Robot ranks higher friends like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ultimatecolemanhawkins" title="Open Coleman Hawkins MySpace profile">Coleman Hawkins</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/shunsukefujita" title="Open Shunsuke Fujita MySpace profile">Shunsuke Fujita</a> (Jazz) and lower friends like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/bobdylan" title="Open Bob Dylan MySpace profile">Bob Dylan</a> (Rock).</p>

<p>The purpose of MySpace Robot is to uncover artists that are not very famous but are indeed associated. Shunsuke Fujita, for instance, is not very famous, but his music shares a <strong>strong affinity</strong> with jazz themes by Miles Davis. Therefore, MySpace users who like Miles Davis' music might enjoy his themes as well.</p>
<p>MySpace Robot was designed to send messages to MySpace profiles of musicians who are not relative friends but might enjoy each other's music.
The feedback received was later employed by MySpace Robot to improve its <strong>recommendation engine</strong> and help other MySpace users discover music they might like.</p>
