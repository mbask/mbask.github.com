This was my first ever Barcamp and I attended with my friends; [@martinrue][martinrue], [@awicher][awicher] and [@jedw][jedw]. I got the train up to Manchester on the Friday before (had to do Nottingham to Manchester standing up, for two hours). Friday night I was reading over and helping with changes to the presentation that Martin was going to do on *DLL injection*.

Due to staying up and messing with Martinâ€™s presentation, we only got around 2 hours sleep before we had got up to catch our lift with [@jedw][jedw]. Upon arriving we parked up, and checked into the hotel and had a quick McDonald's breakfast.

## Day of Barcamp Blackpool

We arrived at the Pleasure Beach and registered for our chippy teas and our beer tokens, which we eventually not need to use (thanks to those who didn't turn up and Yahoo! Developer Network). After Gemma's introduction, everyone was scheduling their talks.

There were a lot of interesting talks on the board, ranging from Ernie the Electronic Organist, to a talk on British Sign Language. I attended talks on a BBC Micro that plays the church organ, Amazon EC2 and Martin's DLL injection talk.

For lunch we had a buffet-style lunch paid for by the CTI Group! There was a ton of food so plenty for seconds. After dinner we chilled in a booth for a bit and got chatting with [@perki][perki]. We decided we should all download the internet. Unfortunately after discussing this the WiFi went down, so the internet was unavailable. Once all the talks had finished we went for a chippy tea where the portions were quite large.

Once we got back to the venue the main room had changed with plenty of tables ready for Paul Sylvester who was performing a magic show for everyone. Paul is Magics Best Kept Secret, but should probably rebrand as Magics Most Tweeted About after Barcamp Blackpool. Provided great entertainment in the form of comedy and magic. The night rounded off with chatting to some cool people and finally falling asleep around 3am when everyone came back from some club they went to.

I was really pleased I attended this weekend, I had met some really cool new people:

* [@timhastings][timhastings]
* [@jreast][jreast]
* [@mheap][mheap]
* [@ruby\_gem][ruby_gem]
* [@kianryan][kianryan]
* [@perki][perki]
* [@plip][plip]
* [@daveverwer][daveverwer]
* and more

I have my ticket for Barcamp Manchester, hopefully catch up with a few people there!
