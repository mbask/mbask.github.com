desc: I wrote a continuous integration <strong>test suite</strong> for vLex.com to catch errors before paying customers experience them
---
<p><a href="http://www.vlex.com" title="Open vlex.com">vLex.com</a> grants worldwide access to millions of legal texts for thousands of paying customers. In 2010, I joined vLex and created an <strong>integration test suite</strong> to continuously guarantee the quality of the service provided. After evaluating different options (Runcoderun, Capybara, CI-Hudson), I chose to work with <a href="http://integrityapp.com/" title="Open Integrity App">integrity</a> on a dedicated Amazon <em>ec2</em> server.</p>
<p>I did not focus on the correctness of the source code, but rather on simulating the behaviour of real users navigating the site through their browsers. For this purpose, I combined integrity with the flexibility of the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" title="Open Selenium HQ">Selenium</a> framework server.

<p>My first step was to write stories to describe all the possible user behaviours (registered or not) and situations (changing payload, 13 languages, 134 countries). For this purpose, I used Cucumber. Afterwards I translated stories into executable steps with Webrat and RSpec.</p>
<p>Finally, I faced the hardest phase: to spread the love for test-driven development to entire team of 8 developers, making them learn how to use the continuous integration suite to evaluate the quality of their code before deploying changes to production. To support my work, I documented the whole module extensively and set up an <a href="http://vlex.github.com/2010/04/cucumber-selenium/" title="Open vLex Github page">introductory web page to web testing tools</a>.
