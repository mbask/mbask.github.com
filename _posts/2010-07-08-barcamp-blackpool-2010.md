snip: More Sun. Sea. Geekery. With added air hockey.

It's been about 9 months since the last Barcamp Blackpool and I was looking forward to this one because I wouldn't need to travel for 5 hours on a train. I had originally planned to do a talk on why people should use version control for their projects, however I hadn't got around to finishing the slides or preparation for the talk (maybe do this one at Barcamp Nottingham?).

## Last Minute Prepartion...  As Usual

On the commute to work [@martinrue][martinrue] said he had this idea for an interesting talk for Barcamp Blackpool. The suggestion was we do a *big fat geek quiz of the year*, which would be done as an ASP.NET MVC web application. As I was partly tired as I usually am in the morning, I asked him to go into more detail. I cannot exactly remember what we discussed, but we decided we would start the project at lunch with less than 24 hours to go until Barcamp Blackpool.

The original idea was to have a simple ASP.NET MVC project with no data access layer or business logic layer, and just be a very simple web application. When lunch came around we started to work on the web site, which [@martinrue][martinrue] had already started layout wise, and a simple database.

We worked on it a bit more during the afternoon break, getting it displaying questions on a main screen, and displaying the multiple choice answers for teams. The idea was to have questions change once all the teams had answered (more on this later). We also decided to work on it for a few hours after work at my apartment. However as I had not yet seen the Doctor Who finale, I got distracted watching that, while I still threw out suggestions to [@martinrue][martinrue] while he was working on the website.

On the morning of Barcamp Blackpool we met up at the train station and decided to do as much work as we could on the train heading to Blackpool. We decided we would try to get a slot during the last session time slot as to give us the greatest chance of finishing the geek quiz in time.

## During the day

We only had a couple of features left to finish in the geek quiz web application, and the major part... adding questions to the database. As we didn't feel like joining the end of the pie queue we got lunch at what I think was a fish and chip shop. The only thing on our minds was "we still have 35 questions to come up with, for the quiz". After lunch I decided to catch [@mountrec][mountrec]'s talk about his own recruitment agency and how he does things differently. Prior to this I had only spoken to [@mountrec][mountrec] via Twitter or email.

I passively listened to talks that went on in the middle room whilst working on questions for the quiz. We had finished the geek quiz web application as much as possible, then we started coming up with questions. If you ever want to put a person on the spot just ask them to come up with a geek question, on the spot. It works everytime. The last commit to the geek quiz repository was literally7-8 minutes before it was due to start.

## First Ever Barcamp Unattended Geek Quiz

We weren't expecting many people to actually show up for our geek quiz, and we were actually doubting if it would even work correctly. Fortunately we had about 9 teams playing ranging from 1-3 team members per team. The quiz was in progress. One of the <del>bugs</del> features actually turned out to be a good part of the quiz, as people who were there will remember.

I would like the thank everyone that was a beta tester for the geek quiz, and [@martinrue][martinrue] and I are planning to work on it and make improvements for future Barcamps. 

## Evening Entertainment

Having attended Barcamp Blackpool last year, I already knew how amazing Paul Sylvester was, so I was looking forward to see him top last years performance. For dinner we had a buffet provided by the venue which was enough for two visits to the buffet. Prior to the evening entertain I sustained injuries from playing 7 games of air hockey with [@martinrue][martinrue] and [@markkirschstein][markkirschstein], and still have said injuries to this day.

Finally we got the evenings magic entertainment with Paul Sylvester. Two words could easily summarise the performance; Egg and roulette. Some of the tricks I had seen last year, but the new tricks impressed me this year. Look forward to seeing Paul Sylvester at the next Barcamp Blackpool.

## Thanks

I thoroughly enjoyed Barcamp Blackpool this year, having met old friends, and made some new friends. Would like to give a special thanks to [@ruby\_gem][ruby_gem] for organising yet another awesome Barcamp Blackpool, and I'm looking forward to Barcamp Blackpool 3, or maybe even Barcamp Nottingham.
