desc: I <strong>designed the web page</strong> for a consultancy company combining strict web standards with advanced scripting bits 
---
<p>
The site was built based on the needs expressed by the customer to showcase a list of services provided by Boxoffice Consulting, a consultancy agency for the movie industry.
</p>
<p>As a programmer, the challenge was to offer a clear image of the agency in the frame of a web page accessible by every browser on every device and in multiple languages. 
</p>  
<img src="/images/{{page.title|downcase}}.png" alt="Screenshot of {{ page.name }}" />
<p>
The result has been a web site that complies with the <strong>latest web standards</strong>. The code validates as <em>xhtml strict</em> and passes <em>wai</em> <strong>accessibility</strong> tests.
Hyper-links are clearly separated for an easier navigation on smaller screens and the viewport is optimised for the iPhone device.</p>
<p>An advanced <em>javascript</em> script enables users to flip through sections without reloading the main frame. The script falls back gracefully on older browsers. The entire web site weighs less than <em>800kb</em>, which guarantees fast access.
