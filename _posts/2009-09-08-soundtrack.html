desc: I wrote the <strong>audio engine for a video game</strong> developed for the Xbox which includes an interactive soundtrack
---
<p>
  I love video games and for one year I had the chance to work in <a href="http://www.playstos.com" title="Open Playstos page">Playstos</a>, 
  a Milan-based company preparing its first worldwide release: <a href="http://www.rufftrigger.com" title="Open Ruff Trigger page">Ruff Trigger &ndash; The Vanocore Conspiracy</a>.
</p>
<p>
  My job started as an A.I. programmer (mostly Finite State Machines) but I was soon moved to the audio department,
  to help the composer seamlessly integrate sound FX and music clips into the game.

<p>
  My most valuable contribution was the development of an <strong>interactive soundtrack</strong> system which
  enabled the music to adapt in real time to the state and actions of the game.
  The soundtrack was made of a series of <strong>audio bricks</strong> that the audio engine automatically sequenced
  according to the number of enemies, level of energy, upcoming dangers.

  Although my work focused on the Microsoft Xbox platform, the game was eventually released for Sony Playstation 2. Due to copyright licenses, the full source code cannot be disclosed to the public.
