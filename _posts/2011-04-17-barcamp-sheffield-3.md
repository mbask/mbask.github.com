title: Barcamp Sheffield 3
snip: First time actually giving a talk at a Barcamp
---

Barcamp Sheffield was my first Barcamp this year. With Nottingham, and Blackpool to look forward to later in the year. I was hoping to stay overnight from Friday to Sunday, but unfortunately hotels were charging "events" rates due to Snooker that weekend. So I was either going to only attend Saturday, or try to survive the midnight oil burning (not as easy as I'm getting older).

I got a some-what early night on Friday so I would have had enough sleep for the weekend, and promptly woke up at 7:30 on Saturday to get ready to catch the train(s) to Sheffield. I caught the 8:12 train to Manchester Piccadilly, and used the 40 minute journey to check my slides and demo code I was using for my presentation. Then for the Manchester to Sheffield leg of my journey I just chilled listening to some music.

## The Venue

I arrived at [the venue][venue] at about 10:20 and not many people had arrived yet. I met up with [Martin][martinrue], and [Ben Nuttall][bennuttall]. Promptly at around 11:00 we had [Jag Gill][jagusti] open with an introduction. This was my first Barcamp where I was actually going to give a talk about something [I am working on][jessica].

## The Talks

First talk I attended was Martin's talk on **sentiment analysis**. I had already seen the implementation and theory behind what he was presenting, but I mainly attended for *trolling* (and moral support). Following Martin's talk I was presenting my micro web framework [Jessica][jessicafx]. I was happy with the number of people who came to see my talk, and I was expecting a lot less considering my talk was *.NET* oriented. I will probably refine my talk a bit including a *File*&rarr;*New Project* demo as well as my prewritten demos, with Jessica hopefully being *v1.0.0* or higher. Also [Tim Hastings][timhastings] needs to work on his *trolling* for future Barcamps!

Martin and I sat and absorbed some talks via osmosis. We then talked about random things with [Ashley Moran][ashmoran] mostly about things I can't remember. Martin did an impromptu session on his web framework [Tinyweb][tinyweb]. Where he mainly showed off the features via a *File*&rarr;*New Project* demo.

## The Banter

Towards the end of the afternoon a lot of the **North West** geek crowd ended up round a table just talking about random subjects ranging from [Gemma's][ruby_gem] ability to spill wine on just about anything, and statically typed vs. dynamically typed languages. The group around the table was pretty much composed of the following.

* [Gemma][ruby_gem]
* [Martin][martinrue]
* [Ashley][ashmoran]
* [Andrew][andrewdisley]
* [Kerry][kerrysholicar]
* [Alistair][alistair]
* [Tim][timhastings]
* ... and people who I didn't introduce myself to, or catch their names

## The Conclusion

So as the evening drew on I felt I couldn't easily pull an all nighter for the *midnight oil burning*, so I decided to catch a train home, and maybe come back the following day as it was fairly cheap between Manchester and Sheffield. However once I got home I checked train times and they're not great on Sundays, so reluctantly decided to pass on returning for the second day.

On a scale of *crap* to *Barcamp Blackpool*, Barcamp Sheffield has placed itself quite near the *Barcamp Blackpool* end of the scale (but please note only Barcamp Blackpool can ever top Barcamp Blackpool). I shall be happily returning to all future Sheffield Barcamps. This Barcamp has been a great chance to catch up with a few people I haven't seen in over 6 months, and hopefully I'll get to meet up with them again at Nottingham, and/or Blackpool later in the year.

*Please note* if Tim challenges to his game of *21*, accept and make sure you put money on it. You're guaranteed to always win.
