desc: I created a web application that takes a seed song and <strong>generates a musical playlist</strong> with a sense of musical continuity
---
<p>
    The playlist generator was the first project I created as part of my Ph.D. in the area of music and recommender systems. 
    The underlying idea was to collect a large amount of playlists from the web and reuse them to create new playlists that were <strong>meaningful from a musical point of view</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    The code is written in <em>lisp</em>, a functional programming language that allows for backtracking, recursion and is particularly adapt for <strong>Case-Based Reasoning</strong>, the A.I. technique that drives the playlist generator.

<p>
    The program looks in a large data set of playlists for <strong>patterns of successive songs</strong> that co-occur often, then assembles them to build new playlists with a given length and seed song.
    The <em>mod-lisp</em> component allows the programme to be executed remotely from any web browser. 
    Yes, <em>lisp</em> can power advanced web applications!

    This code has been running between 2005 and 2008 on the Strands Labs web server.
    Unfortunately, this server has been dismantled, therefore the application cannot be tried online.
    You can <a href="http://github.com/claudiob/playlist_generator/" title="Link to GitHub code repository">download the source code</a> and run the playlist generator either as a stand-alone application or as an Apache module.
