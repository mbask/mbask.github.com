I started <strong>programming</strong> <em>basic</em> at five on a <em>sharp mz-700</em> connected to the TV set. At eight, my father bought our first <em>pc</em>, a <em>286 intel</em> processor. In <em>1992</em>, with the first modem, I started playing around with <em>gopher</em> and <em>bbs</em>, set up in my friends' houses. The <em>www</em> exploded in 1994, when I built my first web sites in <em>html 2</em> and <em>flash 4</em>. After fifteen years, I am still trying to find the right <strong>form</strong> to involve all of this, with style.

I have left many traces on the web. First of all, there is my inconceivable <strong>love for music</strong>: music <a href="http://myspace.com/megaafonia" title="Link to Megaafon&iacute;a MySpace profile">I play</a>, music <a href="http://myspace.com/laherzio" title="Link to Laherzio MySpace profile">I used to play</a>, music <a href="http://last.fm/user/claudiob" title="Link to claudiob Last.fm profile">I listen to</a>, music <a href="http://last.fm/music/goremix/Live" title="Link to goremix music on Last.fm">I create</a>.
My other passions are <strong>underground railways</strong> and <strong>typography</strong>.

<p>And there is so much more left off-line that I will share with you, fellow stranger, the day we will meet. :)
