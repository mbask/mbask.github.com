desc: I analysed <strong>co-occurrences of artists</strong> in a million playlists to discover which are more representative of each genre
---

<p>
  When two artists or genres co-occur together and closely in many playlists, they have some form of shared cultural affinity. The analysis of a large data set of playlists can uncover <strong>affinity degrees</strong> that represent the way in which people tend to associate artists and genres in their daily listening activities.
</p>
<p>
  For this purpose, I have created a package that mines a set of one million playlists and extracts a series of <strong>fuzzy degrees</strong> of association related to 4,000 popular artists and 26 musical genres.

<p>
  The fuzzy degrees enable to describe <strong>how much two artists or genres are related</strong>. For instance, Madonna is commonly labelled as &lsquo;Rock/Pop&rsquo;, but this package is able to offer a richer description of this artist, detailing how much she is related to &lsquo;Rock/Pop&rsquo;, &lsquo;R&amp;B&rsquo;, &lsquo;Latin&rsquo; and every other genre.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, one can discover which genres are more associated (&lsquo;Rap&rsquo; and &lsquo;R&amp;B&rsquo;) or more different (&lsquo;Rap&rsquo; and &lsquo;Country&rsquo;) and in which measure. Artists can also be compared with respect to their genre affinity distribution.
Finally, the same approach can be used to reveal fuzzy affinity degrees in other domains, for instance <strong>movies</strong>.
