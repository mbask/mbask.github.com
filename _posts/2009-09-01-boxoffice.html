<p>
<a href="http://www.boxoffice.es" title="Open boxoffice.es">Boxoffice.es</a> is the most popular web site I have delivered, with 25,000 monthly visits. The author needed a simple way to <strong>publish articles</strong> and reports on a daily basis. After evaluating different <em>cms</em> options, <strong>Wordpress</strong> was eventually determined as most adapt server-side component for the web site.</p>
<p>Another requirement by the customer was to have the look-and-feel of an <strong>online magazine</strong>, rather than that of a blog. This was accomplished by means of an original theme written in <em>php</em> right for this site.

<img src="/images/{{page.title|downcase}}.png" alt="Screenshot of {{ page.name }}" />
<p>To allow the author to include linked references to each movie, studio, genre and year throughout their articles, I'm currently developing <a href="http://github.com/claudiob/wp-taquilla" title="Link to GitHub code repository">wp-taquilla</a>, a <strong>Wordpress plugin</strong> that improves the admin interface enabling users to add, manage and fill tables in the database directly from the browser.</p>
<p>The front-end is the part I'm most proud of: nice look-and-feel for both the web site and the newsletter, integration with Twitter, Facebook and iGoogle, valid <em>xhtml strict</em> and <em>css</em> code, A-level speed performance (source: <em>y! slow</em>) and the honour of being the <a href="http://www.qualidator.com/WQM/en/Reports/HallOfFame.aspx?domainEnding=.es" title="Link to Qualidator">top rated website in Spain</a> for usability, accessibility and SEO (source: Qualidator).
