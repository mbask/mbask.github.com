# Ask Me A Question

Tom works for a company in Manchester, hacking on C# and JavaScript. When he's
not working there, he's [blogging](http://tombell.org.uk), contributing and
hacking on [open source](https://github.com/tombell). You may remember him from
such projects as [Hubot Factory](https://hubot-factory.herokuapp.com) and
[TrollScript](https://github.com/tombell/trollscript).

Tom enjoys working with Ruby and Sinatra. He also likes to abuse
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)
for fun and profit. Tom also fancies himself as a bit of an evangalist for
[Git](http://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com).
