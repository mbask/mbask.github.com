## [Meet Hubot - Increasing productivity &amp; having fun](/talks/meet-hubot)

Hubot is a Campfire robot created by the folks at GitHub. He was finally open
sourced and everyone could finally run a Hubot within their company. I gave a
lightning talk at the North West Ruby User Group about how inviting Hubot into
your company can help increase productivity and still have a ton of fun.

[Slides &amp; notes](/talks/meet-hubot) from this presentation given at *NWRUG* November 17, 2011 in
Manchester, UK.
